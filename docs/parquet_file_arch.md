## Architecture Diagram
Parquet is referred as columnar format in many books but internally it is like an hybrid format ( Combination of Row and Columnar ).
A Parquet file consists of a header followed by one or more blocks, terminated by a footer. The header contains only a 4-byte magic number, PAR1, that identifies the file as being in Parquet format, and all the file metadata is stored in the footer. The footerâ€™s metadata includes the format version, the schema, any extra key-value pairs, and metadata for every block in the file. The final two fields in the footer are a 4-byte field encoding the length of the footer metadata, and the magic number again (PAR1).

Each block in a Parquet file stores one or more row groups, which is made up of column chunks containing the column data for those rows. The data for each column chunk is written in pages. Each page contains values from the same column, making a page a very good candidate for compression since the values are likely to be similar. The first level of compression is achieved through how the values are encoded. There are different encoding techniques ( Simple encoding, Run-Length encoding, Dictionary encoding, Bit Packing, Delta encoding.

Parquet file properties are set at write time. The properties listed below are appropriate if you are creating Parquet files from Map Reduce, Crunch, Pig, or Hive.

A page is the smallest unit of storage in a Parquet file, so retrieving an arbitrary row requires that the page containing the row be decompressed and decoded. Thus, for single-row lookups, it is more efficient to have smaller pages, so there are fewer values to read through before reaching the target value.

There are three types of metadata: file metadata, column (chunk) metadata and page header metadata.
